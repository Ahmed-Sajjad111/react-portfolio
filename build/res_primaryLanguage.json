      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ahmed Sajjad. Full stack developer utilizing an IT background to innovate in the software industry. Known to be a dedicated problem solver, natural leader, and flexible team member. Using my passion for leadership and for helping others, I decided to help others pursue their dreams as upcoming developers. I help teach students full stack development skills all across the country. Eventually I would like to take my software career towards what I love most, gaming. Software is only limited by the capabilities of your mind. Unfortunately for software, my mind is not limited by anything. ðŸ‘† If you'd like to see my other projects, click my github at the top left of the page.",
